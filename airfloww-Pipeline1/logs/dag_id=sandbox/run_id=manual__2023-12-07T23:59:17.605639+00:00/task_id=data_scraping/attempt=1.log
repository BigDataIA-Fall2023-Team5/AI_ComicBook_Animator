Returned value was: {'THE TEMPEST': "Prospero, the Duke of Milan, was a learned and studious man, who\r\n      lived among his books, leaving the management of his dukedom to his\r\n      brother Antonio, in whom indeed he had complete trust. But that trust was\r\n      ill-rewarded, for Antonio wanted to wear the duke's crown himself, and, to\r\n      gain his ends, would have killed his brother but for the love the people\r\n      bore him. However, with the help of Prospero's great enemy, Alonso, King\r\n      of Naples, he managed to get into his hands the dukedom with all its\r\n      honor, power, and riches. For they took Prospero to sea, and when they\r\n      were far away from land, forced him into a little boat with no tackle,\r\n      mast, or sail. In their cruelty and hatred they put his little daughter,\r\n      Miranda (not yet three years old), into the boat with him, and sailed\r\n      away, leaving them to their fate.\r\n    \n\r\n      But one among the courtiers with Antonio was true to his rightful master,\r\n      Prospero. To save the duke from his enemies was impossible, but much could\r\n      be done to remind him of a subject's love. So this worthy lord, whose name\r\n      was Gonzalo, secretly placed in the boat some fresh water, provisions, and\r\n      clothes, and what Prospero valued most of all, some of his precious books.\r\n    \n\r\n      The boat was cast on an island, and Prospero and his little one landed in\r\n      safety. Now this island was enchanted, and for years had lain under the\r\n      spell of a fell witch, Sycorax, who had imprisoned in the trunks of trees\r\n      all the good spirits she found there. She died shortly before Prospero was\r\n      cast on those shores, but the spirits, of whom Ariel was the chief, still\r\n      remained in their prisons.\r\n    \n\r\n      Prospero was a great magician, for he had devoted himself almost entirely\r\n      to the study of magic during the years in which he allowed his brother to\r\n      manage the affairs of Milan. By his art he set free the imprisoned\r\n      spirits, yet kept them obedient to his will, and they were more truly his\r\n      subjects than his people in Milan had been. For he treated them kindly as\r\n      long as they did his bidding, and he exercised his power over them wisely\r\n      and well. One creature alone he found it necessary to treat with\r\n      harshness: this was Caliban, the son of the wicked old witch, a hideous,\r\n      deformed monster, horrible to look on, and vicious and brutal in all his\r\n      habits.\r\n    \n\r\n      When Miranda was grown up into a maiden, sweet and fair to see, it chanced\r\n      that Antonio and Alonso, with Sebastian, his brother, and Ferdinand, his\r\n      son, were at sea together with old Gonzalo, and their ship came near\r\n      Prospero's island. Prospero, knowing they were there, raised by his art a\r\n      great storm, so that even the sailors on board gave themselves up for\r\n      lost; and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and,\r\n      as his father thought in his grief, was drowned. But Ariel brought him\r\n      safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although they were washed\r\n      overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of the island, and the\r\n      good ship herself, which they all thought had been wrecked, lay at anchor\r\n      in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her. Such wonders could Prospero\r\n      and his spirits perform.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero\r\n      showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and\r\n      told her that it was filled with living human beings like themselves. She,\r\n      in pity of their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it.\r\n      Then her father bade her to have no fear, for he intended to save every\r\n      one of them.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers, and\r\n      that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio\r\n      and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his hands.\r\n    \n\r\n      When he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for Ariel\r\n      was at hand, and he had work for him to do. Ariel, who longed for his\r\n      complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being\r\n      threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when Sycorax\r\n      ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the master who\r\n      had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and promised\r\n      faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Do so,” said Prospero, “and in two days I will discharge thee.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search\r\n      of the young prince. And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near him,\r\n      singing the while--\r\n    \n\n\r\n        “Come unto these yellow sands\r\n      \n\r\n        And then take hands:\r\n      \n\r\n        Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd\r\n      \n\r\n        (The wild waves whist),\r\n      \n\r\n        Foot it featly here and there;\r\n      \n\r\n        And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”\r\n       \n\n\r\n      And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a solemn\r\n      air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his eyes, for\r\n      thus they ran--\r\n    \n\n\r\n        “Full fathom five thy father lies;\r\n      \n\r\n        Of his bones are coral made.\r\n      \n\r\n        Those are pearls that were his eyes,\r\n      \n\r\n        Nothing of him that doth fade,\r\n      \n\r\n        But doth suffer a sea-change\r\n      \n\r\n        Into something rich and strange.\r\n      \n\r\n        Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.\r\n      \n\r\n        Hark! now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!”\r\n       \n\n\r\n      And so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of\r\n      Prospero and Miranda. Then, behold! all happened as Prospero desired. For\r\n      Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen any human\r\n      being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with reverence in her\r\n      eyes, and love in her secret heart.\r\n    \n\r\n      “I might call him,” she said, “a thing divine, for nothing natural I ever\r\n      saw so noble!”\r\n     \n\r\n      And Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--\r\n    \n\r\n      “Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!”\r\n     \n\r\n      Nor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for\r\n      scarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to\r\n      make her his queen if she were willing. But Prospero, though secretly\r\n      delighted, pretended wrath.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n “You come here as a spy,” he said to\r\n      Ferdinand. “I will manacle your neck and feet together, and you shall feed\r\n      on fresh water mussels, withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to\r\n      drink. Follow.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “No,” said Ferdinand, and drew his sword. But on the instant Prospero\r\n      charmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and\r\n      Miranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover. But he\r\n      harshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell. There he\r\n      set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of\r\n      timber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his\r\n      toil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.\r\n    \n\r\n      She in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would not\r\n      let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and she,\r\n      hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he gave\r\n      his consent to their marriage.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”\r\n     \n\r\n      In the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island were\r\n      plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand being\r\n      dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on Alonso's\r\n      death. And they would have carried out their wicked purpose while their\r\n      victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.\r\n    \n\r\n      Many tricks did Ariel play them. Once he set a banquet before them, and\r\n      just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and\r\n      lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet disappeared.\r\n      Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.\r\n    \n\r\n      Prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his cell,\r\n      where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly\r\n      repenting them of their sins.\r\n    \n\r\n      Prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, “And then,”\r\n       said he, “I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll\r\n      drown my book.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in his\r\n      proper shape as the Duke of Milan. Because they repented, he forgave them\r\n      and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly committed him\r\n      and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves. Alonso, who seemed\r\n      sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented the loss of his heir.\r\n      But Prospero drew back a curtain and showed them Ferdinand and Miranda\r\n      playing at chess. Great was Alonso's joy to greet his loved son again, and\r\n      when he heard that the fair maid with whom Ferdinand was playing was\r\n      Prospero's daughter, and that the young folks had plighted their troth, he\r\n      said--\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n “Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow\r\n      still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So all ended happily. The ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they\r\n      all set sail for Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda were to be married.\r\n      Ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the\r\n      rejoicings at the wedding.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then Prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own dukedom,\r\n      where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects. He\r\n      practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not only\r\n      because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his\r\n      bitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took no\r\n      vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.\r\n    \n\r\n      As for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander where\r\n      he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\r\n        “Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\r\n      \n\r\n        In a cowslip's bell I lie;\r\n      \n\r\n        There I couch when owls do cry.\r\n      \n\r\n        On the bat's back I do fly\r\n      \n\r\n        After summer, merrily:\r\n      \n\r\n        Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,\r\n      \n\r\n        Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.”", 'AS YOU LIKE IT': "There was once a wicked Duke named Frederick, who took the dukedom\r\n      that should have belonged to his brother, sending him into exile. His\r\n      brother went into the Forest of Arden, where he lived the life of a bold\r\n      forester, as Robin Hood did in Sherwood Forest in merry England.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n The banished Duke's daughter, Rosalind,\r\n      remained with Celia, Frederick's daughter, and the two loved each other\r\n      more than most sisters. One day there was a wrestling match at Court, and\r\n      Rosalind and Celia went to see it. Charles, a celebrated wrestler, was\r\n      there, who had killed many men in contests of this kind. Orlando, the\r\n      young man he was to wrestle with, was so slender and youthful, that\r\n      Rosalind and Celia thought he would surely be killed, as others had been;\r\n      so they spoke to him, and asked him not to attempt so dangerous an\r\n      adventure; but the only effect of their words was to make him wish more to\r\n      come off well in the encounter, so as to win praise from such sweet\r\n      ladies.\r\n    \n\r\n      Orlando, like Rosalind's father, was being kept out of his inheritance by\r\n      his brother, and was so sad at his brother's unkindness that, until he saw\r\n      Rosalind, he did not care much whether he lived or died. But now the sight\r\n      of the fair Rosalind gave him strength and courage, so that he did\r\n      marvelously, and at last, threw Charles to such a tune, that the wrestler\r\n      had to be carried off the ground. Duke Frederick was pleased with his\r\n      courage, and asked his name.\r\n    \n\r\n      “My name is Orlando, and I am the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys,”\r\n       said the young man.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now Sir Rowland de Boys, when he was alive, had been a good friend to the\r\n      banished Duke, so that Frederick heard with regret whose son Orlando was,\r\n      and would not befriend him. But Rosalind was delighted to hear that this\r\n      handsome young stranger was the son of her father's old friend, and as\r\n      they were going away, she turned back more than once to say another kind\r\n      word to the brave young man.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Gentleman,” she said, giving him a chain from her neck, “wear this for\r\n      me. I could give more, but that my hand lacks means.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Rosalind and Celia, when they were alone, began to talk about the handsome\r\n      wrestler, and Rosalind confessed that she loved him at first sight.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Come, come,” said Celia, “wrestle with thy affections.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Oh,” answered Rosalind, “they take the part of a better wrestler than\r\n      myself. Look, here comes the Duke.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “With his eyes full of anger,” said Celia.\r\n    \n\r\n      “You must leave the Court at once,” he said to Rosalind. “Why?” she asked.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n “Never mind why,” answered the Duke, “you\r\n      are banished. If within ten days you are found within twenty miles of my\r\n      Court, you die.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So Rosalind set out to seek her father, the banished Duke, in the Forest\r\n      of Arden. Celia loved her too much to let her go alone, and as it was\r\n      rather a dangerous journey, Rosalind, being the taller, dressed up as a\r\n      young countryman, and her cousin as a country girl, and Rosalind said that\r\n      she would be called Ganymede, and Celia, Aliena. They were very tired when\r\n      at last they came to the Forest of Arden, and as they were sitting on the\r\n      grass a countryman passed that way, and Ganymede asked him if he could get\r\n      them food. He did so, and told them that a shepherd's flocks and house\r\n      were to be sold. They bought these and settled down as shepherd and\r\n      shepherdess in the forest.\r\n    \n\r\n      In the meantime, Oliver having sought to take his brother Orlando's life,\r\n      Orlando also wandered into the forest, and there met with the rightful\r\n      Duke, and being kindly received, stayed with him. Now, Orlando could think\r\n      of nothing but Rosalind, and he went about the forest carving her name on\r\n      trees, and writing love sonnets and hanging them on the bushes, and there\r\n      Rosalind and Celia found them. One day Orlando met them, but he did not\r\n      know Rosalind in her boy's clothes, though he liked the pretty shepherd\r\n      youth, because he fancied a likeness in him to her he loved.\r\n    \n\r\n      “There is a foolish lover,” said Rosalind, “who haunts these woods and\r\n      hangs sonnets on the trees. If I could find him, I would soon cure him of\r\n      his folly.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Orlando confessed that he was the foolish lover, and Rosalind said--“If\r\n      you will come and see me every day, I will pretend to be Rosalind, and I\r\n      will take her part, and be wayward and contrary, as is the way of women,\r\n      till I make you ashamed of your folly in loving her.”\r\n     \n\r\n      And so every day he went to her house, and took a pleasure in saying to\r\n      her all the pretty things he would have said to Rosalind; and she had the\r\n      fine and secret joy of knowing that all his love-words came to the right\r\n      ears. Thus many days passed pleasantly away.\r\n    \n\r\n      One morning, as Orlando was going to visit Ganymede, he saw a man asleep\r\n      on the ground, and that there was a lioness crouching near, waiting for\r\n      the man who was asleep to wake: for they say that lions will not prey on\r\n      anything that is dead or sleeping. Then Orlando looked at the man, and saw\r\n      that it was his wicked brother, Oliver, who had tried to take his life. He\r\n      fought with the lioness and killed her, and saved his brother's life.\r\n    \n\r\n      While Orlando was fighting the lioness, Oliver woke to see his brother,\r\n      whom he had treated so badly, saving him from a wild beast at the risk of\r\n      his own life. This made him repent of his wickedness, and he begged\r\n      Orlando's pardon, and from thenceforth they were dear brothers. The\r\n      lioness had wounded Orlando's arm so much, that he could not go on to see\r\n      the shepherd, so he sent his brother to ask Ganymede to come to him.\r\n    \n\r\n      Oliver went and told the whole story to Ganymede and Aliena, and Aliena\r\n      was so charmed with his manly way of confessing his faults, that she fell\r\n      in love with him at once. But when Ganymede heard of the danger Orlando\r\n      had been in she fainted; and when she came to herself, said truly enough,\r\n      “I should have been a woman by right.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Oliver went back to his brother and told him all this, saying, “I love\r\n      Aliena so well that I will give up my estates to you and marry her, and\r\n      live here as a shepherd.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Let your wedding be to-morrow,” said Orlando, “and I will ask the Duke\r\n      and his friends.”\r\n     \n\n\n\n\n When Orlando told Ganymede how his\r\n      brother was to be married on the morrow, he added: “Oh, how bitter a thing\r\n      it is to look into happiness through another man's eyes.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Then answered Rosalind, still in Ganymede's dress and speaking with his\r\n      voic--“If you do love Rosalind so near the heart, then when your brother\r\n      marries Aliena, shall you marry her.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Now the next day the Duke and his followers, and Orlando, and Oliver, and\r\n      Aliena, were all gathered together for the wedding.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then Ganymede came in and said to the Duke, “If I bring in your daughter\r\n      Rosalind, will you give her to Orlando here?” “That I would,” said the\r\n      Duke, “if I had all kingdoms to give with her.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “And you say you will have her when I bring her?” she said to Orlando.\r\n      “That would I,” he answered, “were I king of all kingdoms.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Then Rosalind and Celia went out, and Rosalind put on her pretty woman's\r\n      clothes again, and after a while came back.\r\n    \n\r\n      She turned to her father--“I give myself to you, for I am yours.” “If\r\n      there be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my daughter.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Then she said to Orlando, “I give myself to you, for I am yours.” “If\r\n      there be truth in sight,” he said, “you are my Rosalind.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “I will have no father if you be not he,” she said to the Duke, and to\r\n      Orlando, “I will have no husband if you be not he.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So Orlando and Rosalind were married, and Oliver and Celia, and they lived\r\n      happy ever after, returning with the Duke to the kingdom. For Frederick\r\n      had been shown by a holy hermit the wickedness of his ways, and so gave\r\n      back the dukedom of his brother, and himself went into a monastery to pray\r\n      for forgiveness.\r\n    \n\r\n      The wedding was a merry one, in the mossy glades of the forest. A shepherd\r\n      and shepherdess who had been friends with Rosalind, when she was herself\r\n      disguised as a shepherd, were married on the same day, and all with such\r\n      pretty feastings and merrymakings as could be nowhere within four walls,\r\n      but only in the beautiful green wood.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n   Prince Florizel and Perdita", 'ROMEO AND JULIET': "Once upon a time there lived in Verona two great families named Montagu\r\n      and Capulet. They were both rich, and I suppose they were as sensible, in\r\n      most things, as other rich people. But in one thing they were extremely\r\n      silly. There was an old, old quarrel between the two families, and instead\r\n      of making it up like reasonable folks, they made a sort of pet of their\r\n      quarrel, and would not let it die out. So that a Montagu wouldn't speak to\r\n      a Capulet if he met one in the street--nor a Capulet to a Montagu--or if\r\n      they did speak, it was to say rude and unpleasant things, which often\r\n      ended in a fight. And their relations and servants were just as foolish,\r\n      so that street fights and duels and uncomfortablenesses of that kind were\r\n      always growing out of the Montagu-and-Capulet quarrel.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now Lord Capulet, the head of that family, gave a party-- a grand supper\r\n      and a dance--and he was so hospitable that he said anyone might come to it\r\n      except (of course) the Montagues. But there was a young Montagu named\r\n      Romeo, who very much wanted to be there, because Rosaline, the lady he\r\n      loved, had been asked. This lady had never been at all kind to him, and he\r\n      had no reason to love her; but the fact was that he wanted to love\r\n      somebody, and as he hadn't seen the right lady, he was obliged to love the\r\n      wrong one. So to the Capulet's grand party he came, with his friends\r\n      Mercutio and Benvolio.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n Old Capulet welcomed him and his two\r\n      friends very kindly--and young Romeo moved about among the crowd of\r\n      courtly folk dressed in their velvets and satins, the men with jeweled\r\n      sword hilts and collars, and the ladies with brilliant gems on breast and\r\n      arms, and stones of price set in their bright girdles. Romeo was in his\r\n      best too, and though he wore a black mask over his eyes and nose, everyone\r\n      could see by his mouth and his hair, and the way he held his head, that he\r\n      was twelve times handsomer than anyone else in the room.\r\n    \n\r\n      Presently amid the dancers he saw a lady so beautiful and so lovable that\r\n      from that moment he never again gave one thought to that Rosaline whom he\r\n      had thought he loved. And he looked at this other fair lady, as she moved\r\n      in the dance in her white satin and pearls, and all the world seemed vain\r\n      and worthless to him compared with her. And he was saying this, or\r\n      something like it, when Tybalt, Lady Capulet's nephew, hearing his voice,\r\n      knew him to be Romeo. Tybalt, being very angry, went at once to his uncle,\r\n      and told him how a Montagu had come uninvited to the feast; but old\r\n      Capulet was too fine a gentleman to be discourteous to any man under his\r\n      own roof, and he bade Tybalt be quiet. But this young man only waited for\r\n      a chance to quarrel with Romeo.\r\n    \n\r\n      In the meantime Romeo made his way to the fair lady, and told her in sweet\r\n      words that he loved her, and kissed her. Just then her mother sent for\r\n      her, and then Romeo found out that the lady on whom he had set his heart's\r\n      hopes was Juliet, the daughter of Lord Capulet, his sworn foe. So he went\r\n      away, sorrowing indeed, but loving her none the less.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n Then Juliet said to her nurse:\r\n    \n\r\n      “Who is that gentleman that would not dance?”\r\n     \n\r\n      “His name is Romeo, and a Montagu, the only son of your great enemy,”\r\n       answered the nurse.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then Juliet went to her room, and looked out of her window, over the\r\n      beautiful green-grey garden, where the moon was shining. And Romeo was\r\n      hidden in that garden among the trees--because he could not bear to go\r\n      right away without trying to see her again. So she--not knowing him to be\r\n      there--spoke her secret thought aloud, and told the quiet garden how she\r\n      loved Romeo.\r\n    \n\r\n      And Romeo heard and was glad beyond measure. Hidden below, he looked up\r\n      and saw her fair face in the moonlight, framed in the blossoming creepers\r\n      that grew round her window, and as he looked and listened, he felt as\r\n      though he had been carried away in a dream, and set down by some magician\r\n      in that beautiful and enchanted garden.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Ah--why are you called Romeo?” said Juliet. “Since I love you, what does\r\n      it matter what you are called?”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized--henceforth I never will be\r\n      Romeo,” he cried, stepping into the full white moonlight from the shade of\r\n      the cypresses and oleanders that had hidden him.\r\n    \n\r\n      She was frightened at first, but when she saw that it was Romeo himself,\r\n      and no stranger, she too was glad, and, he standing in the garden below\r\n      and she leaning from the window, they spoke long together, each one trying\r\n      to find the sweetest words in the world, to make that pleasant talk that\r\n      lovers use. And the tale of all they said, and the sweet music their\r\n      voices made together, is all set down in a golden book, where you children\r\n      may read it for yourselves some day.\r\n    \n\r\n      And the time passed so quickly, as it does for folk who love each other\r\n      and are together, that when the time came to part, it seemed as though\r\n      they had met but that moment-- and indeed they hardly knew how to part.\r\n    \n\r\n      “I will send to you to-morrow,” said Juliet.\r\n    \n\r\n      And so at last, with lingering and longing, they said good-bye.\r\n    \n\r\n      Juliet went into her room, and a dark curtain bid her bright window. Romeo\r\n      went away through the still and dewy garden like a man in a dream.\r\n    \n\r\n      The next morning, very early, Romeo went to Friar Laurence, a priest, and,\r\n      telling him all the story, begged him to marry him to Juliet without\r\n      delay. And this, after some talk, the priest consented to do.\r\n    \n\r\n      So when Juliet sent her old nurse to Romeo that day to know what he\r\n      purposed to do, the old woman took back a a message that all was well, and\r\n      all things ready for the marriage of Juliet and Romeo on the next morning.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n The young lovers were afraid to ask\r\n      their parents' consent to their marriage, as young people should do,\r\n      because of this foolish old quarrel between the Capulets and the\r\n      Montagues.\r\n    \n\r\n      And Friar Laurence was willing to help the young lovers secretly, because\r\n      he thought that when they were once married their parents might soon be\r\n      told, and that the match might put a happy end to the old quarrel.\r\n    \n\r\n      So the next morning early, Romeo and Juliet were married at Friar\r\n      Laurence's cell, and parted with tears and kisses. And Romeo promised to\r\n      come into the garden that evening, and the nurse got ready a rope-ladder\r\n      to let down from the window, so that Romeo could climb up and talk to his\r\n      dear wife quietly and alone.\r\n    \n\r\n      But that very day a dreadful thing happened.\r\n    \n\r\n      Tybalt, the young man who had been so vexed at Romeo's going to the\r\n      Capulet's feast, met him and his two friends, Mercutio and Benvolio, in\r\n      the street, called Romeo a villain, and asked him to fight. Romeo had no\r\n      wish to fight with Juliet's cousin, but Mercutio drew his sword, and he\r\n      and Tybalt fought. And Mercutio was killed. When Romeo saw that this\r\n      friend was dead, he forgot everything except anger at the man who had\r\n      killed him, and he and Tybalt fought till Tybalt fell dead.\r\n    \n\r\n      So, on the very day of his wedding, Romeo killed his dear Juliet's cousin,\r\n      and was sentenced to be banished. Poor Juliet and her young husband met\r\n      that night indeed; he climbed the rope-ladder among the flowers, and found\r\n      her window, but their meeting was a sad one, and they parted with bitter\r\n      tears and hearts heavy, because they could not know when they should meet\r\n      again.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now Juliet's father, who, of course, had no idea that she was married,\r\n      wished her to wed a gentleman named Paris, and was so angry when she\r\n      refused, that she hurried away to ask Friar Laurence what she should do.\r\n      He advised her to pretend to consent, and then he said:\r\n    \n\r\n      “I will give you a draught that will make you seem to be dead for two\r\n      days, and then when they take you to church it will be to bury you, and\r\n      not to marry you. They will put you in the vault thinking you are dead,\r\n      and before you wake up Romeo and I will be there to take care of you. Will\r\n      you do this, or are you afraid?”\r\n     \n\r\n      “I will do it; talk not to me of fear!” said Juliet. And she went home and\r\n      told her father she would marry Paris. If she had spoken out and told her\r\n      father the truth . . . well, then this would have been a different story.\r\n    \n\r\n      Lord Capulet was very much pleased to get his own way, and set about\r\n      inviting his friends and getting the wedding feast ready. Everyone stayed\r\n      up all night, for there was a great deal to do, and very little time to do\r\n      it in. Lord Capulet was anxious to get Juliet married because he saw she\r\n      was very unhappy. Of course she was really fretting about her husband\r\n      Romeo, but her father thought she was grieving for the death of her cousin\r\n      Tybalt, and he thought marriage would give her something else to think\r\n      about.\r\n    \n\r\n      Early in the morning the nurse came to call Juliet, and to dress her for\r\n      her wedding; but she would not wake, and at last the nurse cried out\r\n      suddenly--\r\n    \n\r\n      “Alas! alas! help! help! my lady's dead! Oh, well-a-day that ever I was\r\n      born!”\r\n     \n\r\n      Lady Capulet came running in, and then Lord Capulet, and Lord Paris, the\r\n      bridegroom. There lay Juliet cold and white and lifeless, and all their\r\n      weeping could not wake her. So it was a burying that day instead of a\r\n      marrying. Meantime Friar Laurence had sent a messenger to Mantua with a\r\n      letter to Romeo telling him of all these things; and all would have been\r\n      well, only the messenger was delayed, and could not go.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n But ill news travels fast. Romeo's servant\r\n      who knew the secret of the marriage, but not of Juliet's pretended death,\r\n      heard of her funeral, and hurried to Mantua to tell Romeo how his young\r\n      wife was dead and lying in the grave.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Is it so?” cried Romeo, heart-broken. “Then I will lie by Juliet's side\r\n      to-night.”\r\n     \n\r\n      And he bought himself a poison, and went straight back to Verona. He\r\n      hastened to the tomb where Juliet was lying. It was not a grave, but a\r\n      vault. He broke open the door, and was just going down the stone steps\r\n      that led to the vault where all the dead Capulets lay, when he heard a\r\n      voice behind him calling on him to stop.\r\n    \n\r\n      It was the Count Paris, who was to have married Juliet that very day.\r\n    \n\r\n      “How dare you come here and disturb the dead bodies of the Capulets, you\r\n      vile Montagu?” cried Paris.\r\n    \n\r\n      Poor Romeo, half mad with sorrow, yet tried to answer gently.\r\n    \n\r\n      “You were told,” said Paris, “that if you returned to Verona you must\r\n      die.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “I must indeed,” said Romeo. “I came here for nothing else. Good, gentle\r\n      youth--leave me! Oh, go--before I do you any harm! I love you better than\r\n      myself--go--leave me here--”\r\n     \n\n\n\n\n Then Paris said, “I defy you, and I arrest\r\n      you as a felon,” and Romeo, in his anger and despair, drew his sword. They\r\n      fought, and Paris was killed.\r\n    \n\r\n      As Romeo's sword pierced him, Paris cried--\r\n    \n\r\n      “Oh, I am slain! If thou be merciful, open the tomb, and lay me with\r\n      Juliet!”\r\n     \n\r\n      And Romeo said, “In faith I will.”\r\n     \n\r\n      And he carried the dead man into the tomb and laid him by the dear\r\n      Juliet's side. Then he kneeled by Juliet and spoke to her, and held her in\r\n      his arms, and kissed her cold lips, believing that she was dead, while all\r\n      the while she was coming nearer and nearer to the time of her awakening.\r\n      Then he drank the poison, and died beside his sweetheart and wife.\r\n    \n\r\n      Now came Friar Laurence when it was too late, and saw all that had\r\n      happened--and then poor Juliet woke out of her sleep to find her husband\r\n      and her friend both dead beside her.\r\n    \n\r\n      The noise of the fight had brought other folks to the place too, and Friar\r\n      Laurence, hearing them, ran away, and Juliet was left alone. She saw the\r\n      cup that had held the poison, and knew how all had happened, and since no\r\n      poison was left for her, she drew her Romeo's dagger and thrust it through\r\n      her heart--and so, falling with her head on her Romeo's breast, she died.\r\n      And here ends the story of these faithful and most unhappy lovers.\r\n    \n\r\n      * * * * * * *\r\n    \n\r\n      And when the old folks knew from Friar Laurence of all that had befallen,\r\n      they sorrowed exceedingly, and now, seeing all the mischief their wicked\r\n      quarrel had wrought, they repented them of it, and over the bodies of\r\n      their dead children they clasped hands at last, in friendship and\r\n      forgiveness.", 'MACBETH': "When a person is asked to tell the story of Macbeth, he can tell two\r\n      stories. One is of a man called Macbeth who came to the throne of Scotland\r\n      by a crime in the year of our Lord 1039, and reigned justly and well, on\r\n      the whole, for fifteen years or more. This story is part of Scottish\r\n      history. The other story issues from a place called Imagination; it is\r\n      gloomy and wonderful, and you shall hear it.\r\n    \n\r\n      A year or two before Edward the Confessor began to rule England, a battle\r\n      was won in Scotland against a Norwegian King by two generals named Macbeth\r\n      and Banquo. After the battle, the generals walked together towards Forres,\r\n      in Elginshire, where Duncan, King of Scotland, was awaiting them.\r\n    \n\r\n      While they were crossing a lonely heath, they saw three bearded women,\r\n      sisters, hand in hand, withered in appearance and wild in their attire.\r\n    \n\n  “Speak, who are you?” demanded Macbeth.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Glamis,” said the first woman.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Hail, Macbeth, chieftain of Cawdor,” said the second woman.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Hail, Macbeth, King that is to be,” said the third woman.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then Banquo asked, “What of me?” and the third woman replied, “Thou shalt\r\n      be the father of kings.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Tell me more,” said Macbeth. “By my father's death I am chieftain of\r\n      Glamis, but the chieftain of Cawdor lives, and the King lives, and his\r\n      children live. Speak, I charge you!”\r\n     \n\r\n      The women replied only by vanishing, as though suddenly mixed with the\r\n      air.\r\n    \n\r\n      Banquo and Macbeth knew then that they had been addressed by witches, and\r\n      were discussing their prophecies when two nobles approached. One of them\r\n      thanked Macbeth, in the King's name, for his military services, and the\r\n      other said, “He bade me call you chieftain of Cawdor.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Macbeth then learned that the man who had yesterday borne that title was\r\n      to die for treason, and he could not help thinking, “The third witch\r\n      called me, 'King that is to be.'”\r\n     \n\n  “Banquo,” he said, “you see that the\r\n      witches spoke truth concerning me. Do you not believe, therefore, that\r\n      your child and grandchild will be kings?”\r\n     \n\r\n      Banquo frowned. Duncan had two sons, Malcolm and Donalbain, and he deemed\r\n      it disloyal to hope that his son Fleance should rule Scotland. He told\r\n      Macbeth that the witches might have intended to tempt them both into\r\n      villainy by their prophecies concerning the throne. Macbeth, however,\r\n      thought the prophecy that he should be King too pleasant to keep to\r\n      himself, and he mentioned it to his wife in a letter.\r\n    \n\r\n      Lady Macbeth was the grand-daughter of a King of Scotland who had died in\r\n      defending his crown against the King who preceded Duncan, and by whose\r\n      order her only brother was slain. To her, Duncan was a reminder of bitter\r\n      wrongs. Her husband had royal blood in his veins, and when she read his\r\n      letter, she was determined that he should be King.\r\n    \n\r\n      When a messenger arrived to inform her that Duncan would pass a night in\r\n      Macbeth's castle, she nerved herself for a very base action.\r\n    \n\r\n      She told Macbeth almost as soon as she saw him that Duncan must spend a\r\n      sunless morrow. She meant that Duncan must die, and that the dead are\r\n      blind. “We will speak further,” said Macbeth uneasily, and at night, with\r\n      his memory full of Duncan's kind words, he would fain have spared his\r\n      guest.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Would you live a coward?” demanded Lady Macbeth, who seems to have\r\n      thought that morality and cowardice were the same.\r\n    \n\n  “I dare do all that may become a man,”\r\n       replied Macbeth; “who dare do more is none.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Why did you write that letter to me?” she inquired fiercely, and with\r\n      bitter words she egged him on to murder, and with cunning words she showed\r\n      him how to do it.\r\n    \n\r\n      After supper Duncan went to bed, and two grooms were placed on guard at\r\n      his bedroom door. Lady Macbeth caused them to drink wine till they were\r\n      stupefied. She then took their daggers and would have killed the King\r\n      herself if his sleeping face had not looked like her father's.\r\n    \n\r\n      Macbeth came later, and found the daggers lying by the grooms; and soon\r\n      with red hands he appeared before his wife, saying, “Methought I heard a\r\n      voice cry, 'Sleep no more! Macbeth destroys the sleeping.'”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Wash your hands,” said she. “Why did you not leave the daggers by the\r\n      grooms? Take them back, and smear the grooms with blood.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “I dare not,” said Macbeth.\r\n    \n\r\n      His wife dared, and she returned to him with hands red as his own, but a\r\n      heart less white, she proudly told him, for she scorned his fear.\r\n    \n\r\n      The murderers heard a knocking, and Macbeth wished it was a knocking which\r\n      could wake the dead. It was the knocking of Macduff, the chieftain of\r\n      Fife, who had been told by Duncan to visit him early. Macbeth went to him,\r\n      and showed him the door of the King's room.\r\n    \n\n  Macduff entered, and came out again\r\n      crying, “O horror! horror! horror!”\r\n     \n\r\n      Macbeth appeared as horror-stricken as Macduff, and pretending that he\r\n      could not bear to see life in Duncan's murderers, he slew the two grooms\r\n      with their own daggers before they could proclaim their innocence.\r\n    \n\r\n      These murders did not shriek out, and Macbeth was crowned at Scone. One of\r\n      Duncan's sons went to Ireland, the other to England. Macbeth was King. But\r\n      he was discontented. The prophecy concerning Banquo oppressed his mind. If\r\n      Fleance were to rule, a son of Macbeth would not rule. Macbeth determined,\r\n      therefore, to murder both Banquo and his son. He hired two ruffians, who\r\n      slew Banquo one night when he was on his way with Fleance to a banquet\r\n      which Macbeth was giving to his nobles. Fleance escaped.\r\n    \n\r\n      Meanwhile Macbeth and his Queen received their guests very graciously, and\r\n      he expressed a wish for them which has been uttered thousands of times\r\n      since his day--“Now good digestion wait on appetite, and health on both.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “We pray your Majesty to sit with us,” said Lennox, a Scotch noble; but\r\n      ere Macbeth could reply, the ghost of Banquo entered the banqueting hall\r\n      and sat in Macbeth's place.\r\n    \n\r\n      Not noticing the ghost, Macbeth observed that, if Banquo were present, he\r\n      could say that he had collected under his roof the choicest chivalry of\r\n      Scotland. Macduff, however, had curtly declined his invitation.\r\n    \n\r\n      The King was again pressed to take a seat, and Lennox, to whom Banquo's\r\n      ghost was invisible, showed him the chair where it sat.\r\n    \n\r\n      But Macbeth, with his eyes of genius, saw the ghost. He saw it like a form\r\n      of mist and blood, and he demanded passionately, “Which of you have done\r\n      this?”\r\n     \n\r\n      Still none saw the ghost but he, and to the ghost Macbeth said, “Thou\r\n      canst not say I did it.”\r\n     \n\r\n      The ghost glided out, and Macbeth was impudent enough to raise a glass of\r\n      wine “to the general joy of the whole table, and to our dear friend\r\n      Banquo, whom we miss.”\r\n     \n\r\n      The toast was drunk as the ghost of Banquo entered for the second time.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Begone!” cried Macbeth. “You are senseless, mindless! Hide in the earth,\r\n      thou horrible shadow.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Again none saw the ghost but he.\r\n    \n\r\n      “What is it your Majesty sees?” asked one of the nobles.\r\n    \n\r\n      The Queen dared not permit an answer to be given to this question. She\r\n      hurriedly begged her guests to quit a sick man who was likely to grow\r\n      worse if he was obliged to talk.\r\n    \n\r\n      Macbeth, however, was well enough next day to converse with the witches\r\n      whose prophecies had so depraved him.\r\n    \n\r\n      He found them in a cavern on a thunderous day. They were revolving round a\r\n      cauldron in which were boiling particles of many strange and horrible\r\n      creatures, and they knew he was coming before he arrived.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Answer me what I ask you,” said the King.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Would you rather hear it from us or our masters?” asked the first witch.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Call them,” replied Macbeth.\r\n    \n\r\n      Thereupon the witches poured blood into the cauldron and grease into the\r\n      flame that licked it, and a helmeted head appeared with the visor on, so\r\n      that Macbeth could only see its eyes.\r\n    \n\r\n      He was speaking to the head, when the first witch said gravely, “He knows\r\n      thy thought,” and a voice in the head said, “Macbeth, beware Macduff, the\r\n      chieftain of Fife.” The head then descended Into the cauldron till it\r\n      disappeared.\r\n    \n\r\n      “One word more,” pleaded Macbeth.\r\n    \n\r\n      “He will not be commanded,” said the first witch, and then a crowned child\r\n      ascended from the cauldron bearing a tree in his hand The child said--\r\n    \n\n\r\n        “Macbeth shall be unconquerable till\r\n      \n\r\n        The Wood of Birnam climbs Dunsinane Hill.”\r\n       \n\n\r\n      “That will never be,” said Macbeth; and he asked to be told if Banquo's\r\n      descendants would ever rule Scotland.\r\n    \n\r\n      The cauldron sank into the earth; music was heard, and a procession of\r\n      phantom kings filed past Macbeth; behind them was Banquo's ghost. In each\r\n      king, Macbeth saw a likeness to Banquo, and he counted eight kings.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then he was suddenly left alone.\r\n    \n\r\n      His next proceeding was to send murderers to Macduff's castle. They did\r\n      not find Macduff, and asked Lady Macduff where he was. She gave a stinging\r\n      answer, and her questioner called Macduff a traitor. “Thou liest!” shouted\r\n      Macduff's little son, who was immediately stabbed, and with his last\r\n      breath entreated his mother to fly. The murderers did not leave the castle\r\n      while one of its inmates remained alive.\r\n    \n\r\n      Macduff was in England listening, with Malcolm, to a doctor's tale of\r\n      cures wrought by Edward the Confessor when his friend Ross came to tell\r\n      him that his wife and children were no more. At first Ross dared not speak\r\n      the truth, and turn Macduff's bright sympathy with sufferers relieved by\r\n      royal virtue into sorrow and hatred. But when Malcolm said that England\r\n      was sending an army into Scotland against Macbeth, Ross blurted out his\r\n      news, and Macduff cried, “All dead, did you say? All my\r\n      pretty ones and their mother? Did you say all?”\r\n     \n\r\n      His sorry hope was in revenge, but if he could have looked into Macbeth's\r\n      castle on Dunsinane Hill, he would have seen at work a force more solemn\r\n      than revenge. Retribution was working, for Lady Macbeth was mad. She\r\n      walked in her sleep amid ghastly dreams. She was wont to wash her hands\r\n      for a quarter of an hour at a time; but after all her washing, would still\r\n      see a red spot of blood upon her skin. It was pitiful to hear her cry that\r\n      all the perfumes of Arabia could not sweeten her little hand.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased?” inquired Macbeth of the\r\n      doctor, but the doctor replied that his patient must minister to her own\r\n      mind. This reply gave Macbeth a scorn of medicine. “Throw physic to the\r\n      dogs,” he said; “I'll none of it.”\r\n     \n\r\n      One day he heard a sound of women crying. An officer approached him and\r\n      said, “The Queen, your Majesty, is dead.” “Out, brief candle,” muttered\r\n      Macbeth, meaning that life was like a candle, at the mercy of a puff of\r\n      air. He did not weep; he was too familiar with death.\r\n    \n\r\n      Presently a messenger told him that he saw Birnam Wood on the march.\r\n      Macbeth called him a liar and a slave, and threatened to hang him if he\r\n      had made a mistake. “If you are right you can hang me,” he said.\r\n    \n\n  From the turret windows of Dunsinane\r\n      Castle, Birnam Wood did indeed appear to be marching. Every soldier of the\r\n      English army held aloft a bough which he had cut from a tree in that wood,\r\n      and like human trees they climbed Dunsinane Hill.\r\n    \n\r\n      Macbeth had still his courage. He went to battle to conquer or die, and\r\n      the first thing he did was to kill the English general's son in single\r\n      combat. Macbeth then felt that no man could fight him and live, and when\r\n      Macduff came to him blazing for revenge, Macbeth said to him, “Go back; I\r\n      have spilt too much of your blood already.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “My voice is in my sword,” replied Macduff, and hacked at him and bade him\r\n      yield.\r\n    \n\r\n      “I will not yield!” said Macbeth, but his last hour had struck. He fell.\r\n    \n\r\n      Macbeth's men were in retreat when Macduff came before Malcolm holding a\r\n      King's head by the hair.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Hail, King!” he said; and the new King looked at the old.\r\n    \n\r\n      So Malcolm reigned after Macbeth; but in years that came afterwards the\r\n      descendants of Banquo were kings.", 'THE COMEDY OF ERRORS': "AEGEON was a merchant of Syracuse, which is a seaport in Sicily. His\r\n      wife was AEmilia, and they were very happy until AEgeon's manager died,\r\n      and he was obliged to go by himself to a place called Epidamnum on the\r\n      Adriatic. As soon as she could AEmilia followed him, and after they had\r\n      been together some time two baby boys were born to them. The babies were\r\n      exactly alike; even when they were dressed differently they looked the\r\n      same.\r\n    \n\r\n      And now you must believe a very strange thing. At the same inn where these\r\n      children were born, and on the same day, two baby boys were born to a much\r\n      poorer couple than AEmilia and AEgeon; so poor, indeed, were the parents\r\n      of these twins that they sold them to the parents of the other twins.\r\n    \n\r\n      AEmilia was eager to show her children to her friends in Syracuse, and in\r\n      treacherous weather she and AEgeon and the four babies sailed homewards.\r\n    \n\r\n      They were still far from Syracuse when their ship sprang a leak, and the\r\n      crew left it in a body by the only boat, caring little what became of\r\n      their passengers.\r\n    \n\r\n      AEmilia fastened one of her children to a mast and tied one of the\r\n      slave-children to him; AEgeon followed her example with the remaining\r\n      children. Then the parents secured themselves to the same masts, and hoped\r\n      for safety.\r\n    \n\r\n      The ship, however, suddenly struck a rock and was split in two, and\r\n      AEmilia, and the two children whom she had tied, floated away from AEgeon\r\n      and the other children. AEmilia and her charges were picked up by some\r\n      people of Epidamnum, but some fishermen of Corinth took the babies from\r\n      her by force, and she returned to Epidanmum alone, and very miserable.\r\n      Afterwards she settled in Ephesus, a famous town in Asia Minor.\r\n    \n\r\n      AEgeon and his charges were also saved; and, more fortunate than AEmilia,\r\n      he was able to return to Syracuse and keep them till they were eighteen.\r\n      His own child he called Antipholus, and the slavechild he called Dromio;\r\n      and, strangely enough, these were the names given to the children who\r\n      floated away from him.\r\n    \n\r\n      At the age of eighteen the son who was with AEgeon grew restless with a\r\n      desire to find his brother. AEgeon let him depart with his servant, and\r\n      the young men are henceforth known as Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of\r\n      Syracuse.\r\n    \n\n  Let alone, AEgeon found his home too dreary\r\n      to dwell in, and traveled for five years. He did not, during his absence,\r\n      learn all the news of Syracuse, or he would never have gone to Ephesus.\r\n    \n\r\n      As it was, his melancholy wandering ceased in that town, where he was\r\n      arrested almost as soon as he arrived. He then found that the Duke of\r\n      Syracuse had been acting in so tyrannical a manner to Ephesians unlucky\r\n      enough to fall into his hands, that the Government of Ephesus had angrily\r\n      passed a law which punished by death or a fine of a thousand pounds any\r\n      Syracusan who should come to Ephesus. AEgeon was brought before Solinus,\r\n      Duke of Ephesus, who told him that he must die or pay a thousand pounds\r\n      before the end of the day.\r\n    \n\r\n      You will think there was fate in this when I tell you that the children\r\n      who were kidnaped by the fishermen of Corinth were now citizens of\r\n      Ephesus, whither they had been brought by Duke Menaphon, an uncle of Duke\r\n      Solinus. They will henceforth be called Antipholus of Ephesus and Dromio\r\n      of Ephesus.\r\n    \n\r\n      Moreover, on the very day when AEgeon was arrested, Antipholus of Syracuse\r\n      landed in Ephesus and pretended that he came from Epidamnum in order to\r\n      avoid a penalty. He handed his money to his servant Dromio of Syracuse,\r\n      and bade him take it to the Centaur Inn and remain there till he came.\r\n    \n\r\n      In less than ten minutes he was met on the Mart by Dromio of Ephesus, his\r\n      brother's slave, and immediately mistook him for his own Dromio. “Why are\r\n      you back so soon? Where did you leave the money?” asked Antipholus of\r\n      Syracuse.\r\n    \n\r\n      This Drornio knew of no money except sixpence, which he had received on\r\n      the previous Wednesday and given to the saddler; but he did know that his\r\n      mistress was annoyed because his master was not in to dinner, and he asked\r\n      Antipholus of Syracuse to go to a house called The Phoenix without delay.\r\n      His speech angered the hearer, who would have beaten him if he had not\r\n      fled. Antipholus of Syracuse them went to The Centaur, found that his gold\r\n      had been deposited there, and walked out of the inn.\r\n    \n\r\n      He was wandering about Ephesus when two beautiful ladies signaled to him\r\n      with their hands. They were sisters, and their names were Adriana and\r\n      Luciana. Adriana was the wife of his brother Antipholus of Ephesus, and\r\n      she had made up her mind, from the strange account given her by Dromio of\r\n      Ephesus, that her husband preferred another woman to his wife. “Ay, you\r\n      may look as if you did not know me,” she said to the man who was really\r\n      her brother-in-law, “but I can remember when no words were sweet unless I\r\n      said them, no meat flavorsome unless I carved it.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Is it I you address?” said Antipholus of Syracuse stiffly. “I do not know\r\n      you.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “Fie, brother,” said Luciana. “You know perfectly well that she sent\r\n      Dromio to you to bid you come to dinner;” and Adriana said, “Come, come; I\r\n      have been made a fool of long enough. My truant husband shall dine with me\r\n      and confess his silly pranks and be forgiven.”\r\n     \n\r\n      They were determined ladies, and Antipholus of Syracuse grew weary of\r\n      disputing with them, and followed them obediently to The Phoenix, where a\r\n      very late “mid-day” dinner awaited them.\r\n    \n\r\n      They were at dinner when Antipholus of Ephesus and his slave Dromio\r\n      demanded admittance. “Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cecily, Gillian, Ginn!”\r\n       shouted Dromio of Ephesus, who knew all his fellow-servants' names by\r\n      heart.\r\n    \n\r\n      From within came the reply, “Fool, dray-horse, coxcomb, idiot!” It was\r\n      Dromio of Syracuse unconsciously insulting his brother.\r\n    \n\r\n      Master and man did their best to get in, short of using a crowbar, and\r\n      finally went away; but Antipholus of Ephesus felt so annoyed with his wife\r\n      that he decided to give a gold chain which he had promised her, to another\r\n      woman.\r\n    \n\r\n      Inside The Phoenix, Luciana, who believed Antipholus of Syracuse to be her\r\n      sister's husband, attempted, by a discourse in rhyme, when alone with him,\r\n      to make him kinder to Adriana. In reply he told her that he was not\r\n      married, but that he loved her so much that, if Luciana were a mermaid, he\r\n      would gladly lie on the sea if he might feel beneath him her floating\r\n      golden hair.\r\n    \n\r\n      Luciana was shocked and left him, and reported his lovemaking to Adriana,\r\n      who said that her husband was old and ugly, and not fit to be seen or\r\n      heard, though secretly she was very fond of him.\r\n    \n\r\n      Antipholus of Syracuse soon received a visitor in the shape of Angelo the\r\n      goldsmith, of whom Antipholus of Ephesus had ordered the chain which he\r\n      had promised his wife and intended to give to another woman.\r\n    \n\r\n      The goldsmith handed the chain to Antipholus of Syracuse, and treated his\r\n      “I bespoke it not” as mere fun, so that the puzzled merchant took the\r\n      chain as good-humoredly as he had partaken of Adriana's dinner. He offered\r\n      payment, but Angelo foolishly said he would call again.\r\n    \n\n  The consequence was that Angelo was\r\n      without money when a creditor of the sort that stands no nonsense,\r\n      threatened him with arrest unless he paid his debt immediately. This\r\n      creditor had brought a police officer with him, and Angelo was relieved to\r\n      see Antipholus of Ephesus coming out of the house where he had been dining\r\n      because he had been locked out of The Phoenix. Bitter was Angelo's dismay\r\n      when Antipholus denied receipt of the chain. Angelo could have sent his\r\n      mother to prison if she had said that, and he gave Antipholus of Ephesus\r\n      in charge.\r\n    \n\r\n      At this moment up came Dromio of Syracuse and told the wrong Antipholus\r\n      that he had shipped his goods, and that a favorable wind was blowing. To\r\n      the ears of Antipholus of Ephesus this talk was simple nonsense. He would\r\n      gladly have beaten the slave, but contented himself with crossly telling\r\n      him to hurry to Adriana and bid her send to her arrested husband a purse\r\n      of money which she would find in his desk.\r\n    \n\r\n      Though Adriana was furious with her husband because she thought he had\r\n      been making love to her sister, she did not prevent Luciana from getting\r\n      the purse, and she bade Dromio of Syracuse bring home his master\r\n      immediately.\r\n    \n\r\n      Unfortunately, before Dromio could reach the police station he met his\r\n      real master, who had never been arrested, and did not understand what he\r\n      meant by offering him a purse. Antipholus of Syracuse was further\r\n      surprised when a lady whom he did not know asked him for a chain that he\r\n      had promised her. She was, of course, the lady with whom Antipholus of\r\n      Ephesus had dined when his brother was occupying his place at table.\r\n      “Avaunt, thou witch!” was the answer which, to her astonishment, she\r\n      received.\r\n    \n\r\n      Meanwhile Antipholus of Ephesus waited vainly for the money which was to\r\n      have released him. Never a good-tempered man, he was crazy with anger when\r\n      Dromio of Ephesus, who, of course, had not been instructed to fetch a\r\n      purse, appeared with nothing more useful than a rope. He beat the slave in\r\n      the street despite the remonstrance of the police officer; and his temper\r\n      did not mend when Adriana, Luciana, and a doctor arrived under the\r\n      impression that he was mad and must have his pulse felt. He raged so much\r\n      that men came forward to bind him. But the kindness of Adriana spared him\r\n      this shame. She promised to pay the sum demanded of him, and asked the\r\n      doctor to lead him to The Phoenix.\r\n    \n\n  Angelo's merchant creditor being\r\n      paid, the two were friendly again, and might soon have been seen chatting\r\n      before an abbey about the odd behavior of Antipholus of Ephesus. “Softly,”\r\n       said the merchant at last, “that's he, I think.”\r\n     \n\r\n      It was not; it was Antipholus of Syracuse with his servant Dromio, and he\r\n      wore Angelo's chain round his neck! The reconciled pair fairly pounced\r\n      upon him to know what he meant by denying the receipt of the chain he had\r\n      the impudence to wear. Antipholus of Syracuse lost his temper, and drew\r\n      his sword, and at that moment Adriana and several others appeared. “Hold!”\r\n       shouted the careful wife. “Hurt him not; he is mad. Take his sword away.\r\n      Bind him--and Dromio too.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Dromio of Syracuse did not wish to be bound, and he said to his master,\r\n      “Run, master! Into that abbey, quick, or we shall be robbed!”\r\n     \n\r\n      They accordingly retreated into the abbey.\r\n    \n\r\n      Adriana, Luciana, and a crowd remained outside, and the Abbess came out,\r\n      and said, “People, why do you gather here?”\r\n     \n\r\n      “To fetch my poor distracted husband,” replied Adriana.\r\n    \n\r\n      Angelo and the merchant remarked that they had not known that he was mad.\r\n    \n\r\n      Adriana then told the Abbess rather too much about her wifely worries, for\r\n      the Abbess received the idea that Adriana was a shrew, and that if her\r\n      husband was distracted he had better not return to her for the present.\r\n    \n\r\n      Adriana determined, therefore, to complain to Duke Solinus, and, lo and\r\n      behold! a minute afterwards the great man appeared with officers and two\r\n      others. The others were AEgeon and the headsman. The thousand marks had\r\n      not been found, and AEgeon's fate seemed sealed.\r\n    \n\r\n      Ere the Duke could pass the abbey Adriana knelt before him, and told a\r\n      woeful tale of a mad husband rushing about stealing jewelry and drawing\r\n      his sword, adding that the Abbess refused to allow her to lead him home.\r\n    \n\r\n      The Duke bade the Abbess be summoned, and no sooner had he given the order\r\n      than a servant from The Phoenix ran to Adriana with the tale that his\r\n      master had singed off the doctor's beard.\r\n    \n\r\n      “Nonsense!” said Adriana, “he's in the abbey.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “As sure as I live I speak the truth,” said the servant.\r\n    \n\r\n      Antipholus of Syracuse had not come out of the abbey, before his brother\r\n      of Ephesus prostrated himself in front of the Duke, exclaiming, “Justice,\r\n      most gracious Duke, against that woman.” He pointed to Adriana. “She has\r\n      treated another man like her husband in my own house.”\r\n     \n\n  Even while he was speaking AEgeon said,\r\n      “Unless I am delirious, I see my son Antipholus.”\r\n     \n\r\n      No one noticed him, and Antipholus of Ephesus went on to say how the\r\n      doctor, whom he called “a threadbare juggler,” had been one of a gang who\r\n      tied him to his slave Dromio, and thrust them into a vault whence he had\r\n      escaped by gnawing through his bonds.\r\n    \n\r\n      The Duke could not understand how the same man who spoke to him was seen\r\n      to go into the abbey, and he was still wondering when AEgeon asked\r\n      Antipholus of Ephesus if he was not his son. He replied, “I never saw my\r\n      father in my life;” but so deceived was AEgeon by his likeness to the\r\n      brother whom he had brought up, that he said, “Thou art ashamed to\r\n      acknowledge me in misery.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Soon, however, the Abbess advanced with Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio\r\n      of Syracuse.\r\n    \n\r\n      Then cried Adriana, “I see two husbands or mine eyes deceive me;” and\r\n      Antipholus, espying his father, said, “Thou art AEgeon or his ghost.”\r\n     \n\r\n      It was a day of surprises, for the Abbess said, “I will free that man by\r\n      paying his fine, and gain my husband whom I lost. Speak, AEgeon, for I am\r\n      thy wife AEmilia.”\r\n     \n\r\n      The Duke was touched. “He is free without a fine,” he said.\r\n    \n\r\n      So AEgeon and AEmilia were reunited, and Adriana and her husband\r\n      reconciled; but no one was happier than Antipholus of Syracuse, who, in\r\n      the Duke's presence, went to Luciana and said, “I told you I loved you.\r\n      Will you be my wife?”\r\n     \n\r\n      Her answer was given by a look, and therefore is not written.\r\n    \n\r\n      The two Dromios were glad to think they would receive no more beatings.\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n   Choosing the Casket"}
