and first among them all Prince Ferdinand leaped into the sea, and,\r\n      as his father thought in his grief, was drowned.', 'But Ariel brought him\r\n      safe ashore; and all the rest of the crew, although they were washed\r\n      overboard, were landed unhurt in different parts of the island, and the\r\n      good ship herself, which they all thought had been wrecked, lay at anchor\r\n      in the harbor whither Ariel had brought her.', 'Such wonders could Prospero\r\n      and his spirits perform.', 'While yet the tempest was raging, Prospero\r\n      showed his daughter the brave ship laboring in the trough of the sea, and\r\n      told her that it was filled with living human beings like themselves.', 'She,\r\n      in pity of their lives, prayed him who had raised this storm to quell it.', 'Then her father bade her to have no fear, for he intended to save every\r\n      one of them.', 'Then, for the first time, he told her the story of his life and hers, and\r\n      that he had caused this storm to rise in order that his enemies, Antonio\r\n      and Alonso, who were on board, might be delivered into his hands.', 'When he had made an end of his story he charmed her into sleep, for Ariel\r\n      was at hand, and he had work for him to do.', 'Ariel, who longed for his\r\n      complete freedom, grumbled to be kept in drudgery, but on being\r\n      threateningly reminded of all the sufferings he had undergone when Sycorax\r\n      ruled in the land, and of the debt of gratitude he owed to the master who\r\n      had made those sufferings to end, he ceased to complain, and promised\r\n      faithfully to do whatever Prospero might command.', '“Do so,” said Prospero, “and in two days I will discharge thee.”\r\n     \n\r\n      Then he bade Ariel take the form of a water nymph and sent him in search\r\n      of the young prince.', "And Ariel, invisible to Ferdinand, hovered near him,\r\n      singing the while--\r\n    \n\n\r\n        “Come unto these yellow sands\r\n      \n\r\n        And then take hands:\r\n      \n\r\n        Court'sied when you have, and kiss'd\r\n      \n\r\n        (The wild waves whist),\r\n      \n\r\n        Foot it featly here and there;\r\n      \n\r\n        And, sweet sprites, the burden bear!”\r\n       \n\n\r\n      And Ferdinand followed the magic singing, as the song changed to a solemn\r\n      air, and the words brought grief to his heart, and tears to his eyes, for\r\n      thus they ran--\r\n    \n\n\r\n        “Full fathom five thy father lies;\r\n      \n\r\n        Of his bones are coral made.", 'Those are pearls that were his eyes,\r\n      \n\r\n        Nothing of him that doth fade,\r\n      \n\r\n        But doth suffer a sea-change\r\n      \n\r\n        Into something rich and strange.', 'Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell.', 'Hark!', 'now I hear them,-- ding dong bell!”\r\n       \n\n\r\n      And so singing, Ariel led the spell-bound prince into the presence of\r\n      Prospero and Miranda.', 'Then, behold!'], ['all happened as Prospero desired.', 'For\r\n      Miranda, who had never, since she could first remember, seen any human\r\n      being save her father, looked on the youthful prince with reverence in her\r\n      eyes, and love in her secret heart.', '“I might call him,” she said, “a thing divine, for nothing natural I ever\r\n      saw so noble!”\r\n     \n\r\n      And Ferdinand, beholding her beauty with wonder and delight, exclaimed--\r\n    \n\r\n      “Most sure the goddess on whom these airs attend!”\r\n     \n\r\n      Nor did he attempt to hide the passion which she inspired in him, for\r\n      scarcely had they exchanged half a dozen sentences, before he vowed to\r\n      make her his queen if she were willing.', 'But Prospero, though secretly\r\n      delighted, pretended wrath.', '“You come here as a spy,” he said to\r\n      Ferdinand.', '“I will manacle your neck and feet together, and you shall feed\r\n      on fresh water mussels, withered roots and husk, and have sea-water to\r\n      drink.', 'Follow.”\r\n     \n\r\n      “No,” said Ferdinand, and drew his sword.', 'But on the instant Prospero\r\n      charmed him so that he stood there like a statue, still as stone; and\r\n      Miranda in terror prayed her father to have mercy on her lover.', 'But he\r\n      harshly refused her, and made Ferdinand follow him to his cell.', 'There he\r\n      set the Prince to work, making him remove thousands of heavy logs of\r\n      timber and pile them up; and Ferdinand patiently obeyed, and thought his\r\n      toil all too well repaid by the sympathy of the sweet Miranda.', 'She in very pity would have helped him in his hard work, but he would not\r\n      let her, yet he could not keep from her the secret of his love, and she,\r\n      hearing it, rejoiced and promised to be his wife.', 'Then Prospero released him from his servitude, and glad at heart, he gave\r\n      his consent to their marriage.', "“Take her,” he said, “she is thine own.”\r\n     \n\r\n      In the meantime, Antonio and Sebastian in another part of the island were\r\n      plotting the murder of Alonso, the King of Naples, for Ferdinand being\r\n      dead, as they thought, Sebastian would succeed to the throne on Alonso's\r\n      death.", 'And they would have carried out their wicked purpose while their\r\n      victim was asleep, but that Ariel woke him in good time.', 'Many tricks did Ariel play them.', 'Once he set a banquet before them, and\r\n      just as they were going to fall to, he appeared to them amid thunder and\r\n      lightning in the form of a harpy, and immediately the banquet disappeared.'], ['Then Ariel upbraided them with their sins and vanished too.', 'Prospero by his enchantments drew them all to the grove without his cell,\r\n      where they waited, trembling and afraid, and now at last bitterly\r\n      repenting them of their sins.', "Prospero determined to make one last use of his magic power, “And then,”\r\n       said he, “I'll break my staff and deeper than did ever plummet sound I'll\r\n      drown my book.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So he made heavenly music to sound in the air, and appeared to them in his\r\n      proper shape as the Duke of Milan.", 'Because they repented, he forgave them\r\n      and told them the story of his life since they had cruelly committed him\r\n      and his baby daughter to the mercy of wind and waves.', 'Alonso, who seemed\r\n      sorriest of them all for his past crimes, lamented the loss of his heir.', 'But Prospero drew back a curtain and showed them Ferdinand and Miranda\r\n      playing at chess.', "Great was Alonso's joy to greet his loved son again, and\r\n      when he heard that the fair maid with whom Ferdinand was playing was\r\n      Prospero's daughter, and that the young folks had plighted their troth, he\r\n      said--\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n “Give me your hands, let grief and sorrow\r\n      still embrace his heart that doth not wish you joy.”\r\n     \n\r\n      So all ended happily.", 'The ship was safe in the harbor, and next day they\r\n      all set sail for Naples, where Ferdinand and Miranda were to be married.', 'Ariel gave them calm seas and auspicious gales; and many were the\r\n      rejoicings at the wedding.', 'Then Prospero, after many years of absence, went back to his own dukedom,\r\n      where he was welcomed with great joy by his faithful subjects.', 'He\r\n      practiced the arts of magic no more, but his life was happy, and not only\r\n      because he had found his own again, but chiefly because, when his\r\n      bitterest foes who had done him deadly wrong lay at his mercy, he took no\r\n      vengeance on them, but nobly forgave them.', "As for Ariel, Prospero made him free as air, so that he could wander where\r\n      he would, and sing with a light heart his sweet song--\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\r\n        “Where the bee sucks, there suck I:\r\n      \n\r\n        In a cowslip's bell I lie;\r\n      \n\r\n        There I couch when owls do cry.", "On the bat's back I do fly\r\n      \n\r\n        After summer, merrily:\r\n      \n\r\n        Merrily, merrily, shall I live now,\r\n      \n\r\n        Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.”"]]}
